<h1>Personalised number plates as an investment</h1>

<p>The sales of private number plates continue to post record breaking revenues for HM Treasury. In 2017, the sector generated over <a href="£160%20million%20for%20HM%20Treasury.">&pound;160 million</a> in revenue for the country. Some have estimated that DVLA has earned in excess of &pound;2 billion pounds over the past 25 years from private regs alone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, considering entry level registration marks cost just &pound;250, surely there weren&rsquo;t 640,000 transactions completed in 2017? You&rsquo;re right, there weren&rsquo;t. The massive revenue is partly due to high value sales of premium number plates &ndash; and this doesn&rsquo;t even include private sales, since sales figures are not required to be reported to DVLA. In many cases, the plates aren&rsquo;t even being assigned to vehicles &ndash; they&rsquo;re kept in retention using DVLA&rsquo;s V750 certificates? But why would people spend tens and hundreds of thousands of pounds on number plates they aren&rsquo;t even using? One word &ndash; investment.</p>

<p>Consider this. The &lsquo;F1&rsquo; personalised plate was sold by Essex County Council in 2008 for a fantastic price of <a href="https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/16154411.former-council-number-plate-yours-for-14m/">&pound;440,000</a> to prominent number plate investor Afzal Kahn. In 2013, Kahn received an offer of &pound;6 million for the cherished plate &ndash; he said no. In early 2018, he listed the plate for sale at &pound;12,009.995 (&pound;14.4 million inclusive of VAT and fees). That&rsquo;s a mark-up of almost 3,000 percent over 13 years. Unless you&rsquo;re an early adopter of Bitcoin, there is absolutely no other investment vehicle in the world which could rival the growth rate of personalised number plates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why are personalised number plate prices rising?</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The simple truth is, there is a captive market for personalised number plates. The current number plate format is designed by DVLA to last until 2050, so the entire vehicle-owning population are stuck with the current available alphanumeric permutations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the best and shortest permutations have been purchased long ago, it&rsquo;s a seller&rsquo;s market; they will only sell if their prices are met. Since customers can only buy DVLA approved number plates, this creates an ever growing demand for a finite selection of premium numbers. As a result, prices are guaranteed to rise over the following three decades or so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part is, there is no steep learning curve to master. Once could argue there is practically no learning involved &ndash; simply buy the shortest pronounceable permutation you can afford, and market forces and time will do the rest.</p>
