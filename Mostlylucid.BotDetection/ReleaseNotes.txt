0.5.0-preview2

Composable Action Policy System:
- Named action policies separate from detection policies
- Built-in: block, throttle, challenge, redirect, logonly
- BlockActionPolicy: Configurable status codes, messages, headers
- ThrottleActionPolicy: Jitter, risk-scaling, exponential backoff, stealth mode
- ChallengeActionPolicy: CAPTCHA, JavaScript, proof-of-work challenges
- RedirectActionPolicy: Honeypot, tarpit, error page with templates
- LogOnlyActionPolicy: Shadow mode, debug headers, metrics
- IActionPolicyFactory for configuration-based creation
- IActionPolicyRegistry for runtime policy lookup
- Custom action policies via IActionPolicy interface
- [BotAction("policy-name")] attribute for endpoint overrides
- ActionPolicyName property on detection policies and transitions

0.5.0-preview1

Policy-Based Detection:
- Named policies with configurable detectors per endpoint
- Path-based resolution with glob patterns (/api/*, /admin/**)
- Built-in: default, strict, relaxed, allowVerifiedBots
- Transitions based on risk thresholds and signals
- Per-policy weight overrides
- Actions: Allow, Block, Challenge, Throttle, EscalateToAi

Management Endpoints & Attributes:
- MapBotPolicyEndpoints() for CRUD and testing
- [BotPolicy("strict")] attribute for controllers/actions
- [BotDetector("UserAgent,Header")] for inline ad-hoc detection
- [SkipBotDetection] to bypass detection
- Policy simulation endpoint for testing transitions

Response Headers & TagHelpers:
- Configurable response headers (X-Bot-Risk-Score, X-Bot-Policy)
- <bot-detection-result /> TagHelper for client-side JS integration
- Full JSON result via Base64-encoded header option

Throttling with Jitter:
- Configurable base delay, max delay, jitter percent
- ScaleByRisk option for risk-proportional delays
- DelayResponse to slow bots at TCP level
- Custom throttle messages and challenge types

Blackboard Architecture:
- Event-driven detection with evidence aggregation
- Wave-based parallel execution
- Trigger conditions (WhenSignalExists, WhenRiskExceeds)
- Circuit breakers per detector
- Early exit for high-confidence detections

Pattern Reputation System:
- BotScore, Support, State tracking with time decay
- Online EMA updates, state machine (Neutral → Suspect → ConfirmedBad)
- Manual overrides never auto-downgrade
- Drift detection for bot/human ratio changes

Fast/Slow Path:
- Fast path: sync detectors (<100ms)
- Slow path: async AI/learning via LearningEventBus

New Interfaces:
- IContributingDetector, ILearningEventHandler, IPatternReputationCache
- IPolicyRegistry, IPolicyEvaluator

SQLite Pattern Store, comprehensive documentation

Client-Side Fingerprinting:
- BotDetectionTagHelper for fingerprint collection JS
- Signed token system prevents spoofing
- Detects headless browsers, automation markers

Inconsistency Detection:
- Catches UA/header mismatches
- Cross-signal contradiction detection

Risk Assessment:
- RiskBand enum (Low, Elevated, Medium, High)
- GetRiskBand(), ShouldChallengeRequest(), GetRecommendedAction()

Session-Level Behavioral Analysis:
- Multi-identity tracking (IP, fingerprint, API key, user)
- Anomaly detection (spikes, new paths, timing)

0.0.4-preview1

- ONNX-based detection (1-10ms latency)
- Source-generated regex for performance
- OpenTelemetry metrics integration
- YARP reverse proxy integration
