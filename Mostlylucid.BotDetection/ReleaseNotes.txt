0.5.0-preview1

Blackboard Architecture:
- Event-driven detection where detectors emit evidence, not verdicts
- Wave-based parallel execution - independent detectors run concurrently
- Trigger conditions for reactive detectors (WhenSignalExists, WhenRiskExceeds)
- DetectionContribution as first-class evidence objects with confidence deltas
- EvidenceAggregator for weighted score aggregation
- Circuit breakers per detector for resilience
- Early exit for high-confidence detections

Pattern Reputation System (Learning + Forgetting):
- Patterns track BotScore (0-1), Support (sample count), and State
- Online updates via EMA: new_score = (1-α)*old + α*label
- Time decay: stale patterns drift toward neutral (configurable τ)
- State machine: Neutral → Suspect → ConfirmedBad with hysteresis
- Manual overrides (ManuallyBlocked/Allowed) never auto-downgrade
- Garbage collection for old neutral patterns

Drift Detection:
- Monitors for significant changes in bot/human ratios
- Windowed statistics comparison
- Publishes DriftDetected events for alerting

Fast/Slow Path Architecture:
- Fast path: Sync detectors (<100ms) with consensus-based finalization
- Slow path: Async AI/learning via LearningEventBus
- Configurable thresholds for early exit and slow path triggering

New Interfaces:
- IContributingDetector for blackboard-style detectors
- ILearningEventHandler for background event processing
- IPatternReputationCache for reputation management

SQLite Pattern Store:
- SqliteLearnedPatternStore for persistent pattern storage
- Indexed queries by type, confidence, and state

Documentation:
- Individual docs for each detection type (UA, header, IP, behavioral)
- Extensibility guide with code examples
- Learning system with mermaid diagrams

0.0.5-preview1

Client-Side Fingerprinting:
- BotDetectionTagHelper for fingerprint collection JS
- Signed token system prevents spoofing
- Detects headless browsers, automation markers

Inconsistency Detection:
- Catches UA/header mismatches
- Cross-signal contradiction detection

Risk Assessment:
- RiskBand enum (Low, Elevated, Medium, High)
- GetRiskBand(), ShouldChallengeRequest(), GetRecommendedAction()

Session-Level Behavioral Analysis:
- Multi-identity tracking (IP, fingerprint, API key, user)
- Anomaly detection (spikes, new paths, timing)
